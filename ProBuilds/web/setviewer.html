                    <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
                    <p>
                        You can either <a href="allprosets.zip">download all the item sets</a> or click on an item set on the left (ordered alphabetically by champion then lane). If you click on an item set it will then be displayed here and on the right you can copy and paste it to a file or download the item set file.<br /><br />
                        After you have an item set file or several you must navigate to your League of Legends installation directory. By default that is <span class="filepath">C:\Riot Games\League of Legends</span><br /><br />
                        You will then need to place the item set json file in the sub directory path <span class="filepath">Config\Champions\{championKey}\Recommended\</span> where <span class="filepath">{championKey}</span> is the first name in the path on the right download pane. So for Aatrox it would be <span class="filepath">C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\Config\Champions\Aatrox\Recommended\</span>.<br /><br />
                        If you downloaded all item sets you will want to extract the zip file to the sub directory path <span class="filepath">Config\Champions\</span> and then each folder, sub-folder and json file will be copied to the correct place.<br /><br />
                        There is a chance that the <span class="filepath">{championKey}</span> or sub directory <span class="filepath">Recommended</span> doesn't exist, if this is the case simply create it.

                    <h2>About Pro Item Sets</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pro Item Sets is made up of item sets generated by pulling top tier player match information from the Riot Games API and figuring out at different points in their game what was most commonly purchased.<br /><br />
                        It was developed by <a href="http://www.kyleschouviller.com/">Kyle Schouviller</a> and <a href="www.nathanbowhay.com">Nathan Bowhay</a> for the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/announcements/show/2lxEyIcE"> Riot Games API Challenge 2.0</a> from August 10th to August 31st 2015.<br /><br />
                        For more information about the tool used to generate the item sets, check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/Kyle0654/probuilds">Github</a>.
